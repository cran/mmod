#' Modern Measures of Differentiation
#'
#'
#'Population geneticists have traditionally used Nei's Gst (often confusingly called 
#'Fst...) to measure divergence between populations. Recently, it has become 
#' clear that simple intereptations of the value of Gst can be misleading. For
#' this reason several new measures differntiation have been developed. mmod is
#' a package that brings some of these measures to R. 
#'

#' 
#'The vignette for this package ( avaliable using 
#' vignette("demo", package="mmod") from within R) contains an introduction to
#' these methods and and example usage for this package. I strongly suggest new
#' users start by reading this documentation.
