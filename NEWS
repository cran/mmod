+ Clean up of pairwise function code
+ explicit imports from stats pkg (new CRAN policy)

Small Updates to keep up with best practices (devtools CRAN)

*1.2 __

New function to turn a DNAbin object (from ape) into a genind
with frequency of haplotypes/alleles

Caught some typos and made a number of small changes

* 0.2.1 __

chao_boostrap now uses multinomial distribution to create samples (previously 
it resampled individuals) - this makes very little difference. 

Discussion in chao_bootsrap's documentation about bias in bootstrapping
procedure
Significant speeding up of all functions by using base R as much as possible


* 0.2 __
